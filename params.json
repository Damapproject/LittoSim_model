In 2010, the storm Xynthia highlighted the limits of coastal flooding risk management in France. Besides a deficient alert system, it revealed a lack of risk culture. This problem was especially prevalent among local decision-makers who fail to take into account alternative prevention measures and adaptive strategies. In partnership with the local administration of Oléron Island – a sector strongly affected by storm Xynthia - **we developed a participatory simulation model to foster social learning about coastal risk prevention measures** with local authorities and managers. \r\n\r\n### Your Conceptual Framework\r\n\r\nThis simulation integrates a coastal flooding simulation model and a spatially explicit agent-based model that simulates the development of the area and the management of prevention measures. The participatory set-up was made to create an immersive environment so that participants would remember the coastal flooding simulation displayed. \r\n\r\nA role game mechanism was added in order to simulate the coordination issues between the different decision bodies and levels involved in coastal risk management. Participants’ interfaces were designed to reflect on the opposition between a short term strategy (building more dikes) and a long-term strategy (land-use and housing adaptation).\r\n\r\nIt proved to be very immersive thanks to the combination of displaying coastal flooding simulations on a\r\nvery large screen and of using distributed user-control interfaces. Participants learned about the water\r\nexpansion dynamics during flood events and the effects of building, raising and restoring dikes. Yet, the\r\nmodel still needs improvements to help decision-makers change their mindset on long-term alternative\r\nrisk prevention measures.\r\n\r\n##Technical acknowledgement\r\n\r\n### GAMA-platform\r\nWe use [gama-platforme](http://gama-platform.org/) to develop all social mechanism.
